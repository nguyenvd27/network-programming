I have many hobbies, but I like reading most. Books are always a good friend to me. It is a good way to improve my vocabulary by exposing many new words. By reading, I get better at concentration because it requires me to focus on what I am reading for long periods of time. It also opens up the knowledge door for me. Reading books tells me about the world’s history, let me see the structure of the human body, or bring me a story of Sherlock Holmes. I think reading is one of the most interesting indoors activities.
I like watching movies, especially horror and action movies. I find myself a stronger person when I watch these films. There is another hobby that I really enjoy – gathering with my friends for chatting. I like the Thailand and Chinese cuisines because they are tasty and spicy. Moreover, I enjoy myself by swimming and reading books when I am alone.
